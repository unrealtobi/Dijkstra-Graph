# Dijkstra's Algorithm Implementation

This repository contains a JavaScript implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest distances from a starting vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph.

## Description

Dijkstra's algorithm is a popular graph algorithm used to find the shortest paths from a starting vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph. It accomplishes this by iteratively exploring vertices and updating their shortest distances from the starting vertex.

## Implementation Details

The implementation consists of the following files:

- `index.html`: HTML file for running the JavaScript code.
- `dijkstra.js`: JavaScript file containing the implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm.
- `README.md`: This README file providing an overview of the project.

The `dijkstra.js` file contains the implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm using ES6 syntax. It includes a `dijkstra` function that takes a weighted graph and a starting vertex as input, and returns an object representing the shortest distances from the starting vertex to all other vertices in the graph.
